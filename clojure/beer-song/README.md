# Beer Song

Write a program which produces the lyrics to that beloved classic, that field-trip favorite: 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall.

Note that Not all verses are identical.

The verse for 1 bottle is as follows:

```plain
1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
Take it down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
```

```plain
The verse for 0 bottles is as follows:
No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.
Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
```

You can get multiple verses by passing in the verse to start from, and (optionally) the last verse to include.
